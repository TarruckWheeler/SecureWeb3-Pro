## 🔒 Security Standards

### 🛡️ Secure Coding Practices

**Input Validation:**
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize input
function validateWalletAddress(address) {
    if (!address || typeof address !== 'string') {
        throw new Error('Invalid address format');
    }
    
    const sanitized = address.trim().toLowerCase();
    return isValidAddress(sanitized);
}

// ❌ Bad: No validation
function validateWalletAddress(address) {
    return isValidAddress(address);
}
```

**Error Handling:**
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Don't expose sensitive information
function handleError(error) {
    console.error('Operation failed', error);
    return { success: false, message: 'Operation failed' };
}

// ❌ Bad: Exposes internal details
function handleError(error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.stack };
}
```

**Cryptographic Security:**
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Use secure random generation
function generateSecurePassword(length) {
    const array = new Uint8Array(length);
    crypto.getRandomValues(array);
    return Array.from(array, byte => charset[byte % charset.length]).join('');
}

// ❌ Bad: Weak random generation
function generatePassword(length) {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(0, length);
}
```
